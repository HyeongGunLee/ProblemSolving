/*
 *    BinarySearchTree
 *          * Inorder traversal -> visit the nodes in nondecreasing order.
 *          * height = as small as O(logn) or as large as O(n)
 *              - efficient when they have small height
 *
 *     * Euler tour traversal =>  walk around T, left, below, right
 *                            =>  same as preorder
 *                            => parentheses=> on the left: ( , from below: print the value,
 *                                             on the right: )
